Microfluidic Chip Layout
========


The microfluidic chip was designed in AutoCAD 2012.  Darkfield mylar transparencies were printed (from Fineline Imaging) and SU8/silicon molds were fabricated using standard techniques.  The chamber height (circles) was 200 um while the channel height was 10 um.  The PDMS was poured to a height of 4mm.  See the supplementary info in the PLOS ONE paper for more fabrication details.

This version of the microfluidic disposable cartridge features reaction chambers that are 2mm in diameter.  Although we use 2mm chambers in the paper, 1.5mm would probably be sufficient and would load much faster.  Note that the pitch of the chip is 4.5mm (same as a 384 well plate).
